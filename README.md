# Recursive Chain of Thought Multi-Agent Orchestration Architecture

This project implements a next-generation LLM architecture with the following capabilities:

1. **Permanent Memory**: Maintains and utilizes long-term knowledge across sessions
2. **In-Session Learning**: Fine-tunes itself in real-time during inference
3. **Native Computer Interaction**: Directly interfaces with computer systems, files, code execution and internet APIs
4. **Self-Improvement**: Continuously refines performance using each interaction as a learning opportunity

## Architecture Overview

- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates multiple agents, splits tasks, and manages workflow
- **Parallel Agents**: Use recursive chain-of-thought reasoning to solve problems
- **Aggregator**: Merges outputs from multiple agents using consensus techniques
- **Scoring & Logging**: Evaluates responses and logs interactions for improvement
- **Self-Learning Pipeline**: Automatically refines the system based on performance metrics
- **Memory Systems**: Permanent storage for knowledge and previous interactions

## Implementation Details

See the `docs/` directory for detailed documentation on each component.
