1. System Overview
Your system runs in a loop:

Inputs to the LLM each iteration:
A single, persistent goal prompt (the high-level objective).
A tool menu describing capabilities (e.g., file I/O, shell commands, browser actions).
The accumulated “context” from previous iterations (which you want to manage effectively).
Outputs from the LLM:
Next actions or instructions that the system executes (e.g., writing code, installing packages).
Possibly updated reasoning, solutions, or new sub-plans.
This continues until the system either completes the goal or crashes (due to a bug or an unexpected condition).
To implement a more robust strategy, you’ll integrate:

The Eight-Step Reasoning Framework (Understand → Explore → Propose → Critique → Implement → Test → Conclude → Reflect)
Multi-Tier Memory Management (Short-, Medium-, Long-Term)
2. Multi-Tier Memory Management
2.1 Short-Term Memory (STM)
Purpose: Captures the immediate context needed for the current iteration—recent steps, immediate instructions, and short-term references (e.g., the last 20-50 lines of LLM output or logs).
Token Conservation:
Only keep the most recent and highly relevant lines.
Summarize or chunk older lines to reduce token usage.
Updates:
After each iteration, parse the LLM’s output.
Store any critical new details (e.g., code changes, an error message) as a minimal bullet-point summary.
Possible Novel Approach:
Maintain a “micro-summarizer” that automatically transforms the last iteration’s conversation into 2-3 bullet points capturing the key outcomes or decisions. Insert that summary into STM instead of raw text.
2.2 Medium-Term Memory (MTM)
Purpose: Holds the broader context relevant to the current project or sub-project.
Contains cumulative knowledge: partial solutions, encountered errors, design decisions, code architecture, test results, etc.
Structure & Management:
Thematic Bins or Graph: Organize data by categories like “Failed Approaches,” “Working Approaches,” “Dependencies,” “Bugs Observed,” etc.
Versioned Summaries: For code, keep incremental “diffs” or short summaries like “We have created a function foo() that does X. Tests show it fails with error Y.”
Promotion & Demotion:
If a piece of data remains highly relevant (e.g., a persistent bug or known method), keep it pinned in MTM.
Otherwise, demote older or resolved items to a summarized format to save tokens.
Novel Approach:
Use weight scores or “relevance scoring” to decide whether an item is included in the next iteration’s context.
E.g., each piece of memory has a recency factor and a usage factor (how many times we referenced it). Once either factor is below a threshold, it gets summarized or pruned.
2.3 Long-Term Memory (LTM)
Purpose: Stores knowledge across multiple sessions or projects—lessons learned, best practices, or major code patterns that can be reused in the future.
Retrieval Mechanism:
You do not feed everything to the model every time; instead, use a vector database or a “search function” so the system can query LTM for relevant items on demand.
(e.g., “We tried approach X in a previous project, it failed. Retrieve that snippet if we see a similar approach forming.”)
Token Efficiency:
Do not automatically load LTM in your main prompt.
Only load specific items that match current tasks, using some embedding-based search or keyword matching.
Novel Approach:
Periodic offline training or fine-tuning with the newly discovered patterns, so the system gradually “internalizes” repeated insights.
Or use specialized “knowledge distillation” steps that compress large amounts of LTM data into essential bullet points or heuristics.
3. Integrating the Eight-Step Reasoning Loop
Even though your system uses a single persistent prompt, you can incorporate the 8-step reasoning by:

Explicitly Instructing the Model each iteration to proceed systematically through the steps, or
Scripting the framework into the prompt so the model self-organizes into these steps.
In practice, you can represent each step as a “stage” in your memory or conversation. The system might do something like:

Step 1: Understand & Restate
Prompt Snippet (added to the persistent prompt or each iteration’s instructions):
“Summarize your understanding of the current goal, referencing what has already been done. If you see ambiguities or missing data, highlight them now.”

Step 2: Explore & Hypothesize
Prompt Snippet:
“Identify any alternative approaches or possible solutions not yet tried or partially tried. Analyze feasibility briefly.”

Step 3: Propose a Solution
Prompt Snippet:
“Based on your analysis, propose the next best course of action or solution design. Provide a step-by-step plan.”

Step 4: Self-Critique & Validate
Prompt Snippet:
“Critique your proposed plan. Look for risks, errors, or repeated mistakes from memory. If we’ve tried something similar and failed, address why this approach might succeed now.”

Step 5: Implement / Carry Out
Prompt Snippet:
“Write or modify the code, run a test, or use the relevant tool. Provide the exact commands or script. Summarize what you expect to happen.”

Step 6: Review & Test
Prompt Snippet:
“Check the results of the action. Compare with expected outcomes. If any mismatch, debug or revise the approach.”

Step 7: Conclude & Document
Prompt Snippet:
“Summarize progress so far. Have we solved the sub-goal? If yes, finalize. If not, what is missing?”

Step 8: Reflect & Learn
Prompt Snippet:
“Record any major lessons or patterns discovered for future tasks. Update memory with this reflection.”

In Implementation:

These instructions can be inlined in your big looping prompt.
Each iteration, you parse the output and see which steps were addressed. Then the system automatically calls the next iteration, feeding in relevant memory updates.
4. Practical Loop Implementation
4.1 Iteration Flow
Construct the “Iteration Prompt”

Goal Prompt: (High-level objective)
Current Step: If you’re guiding the system to the next step in the 8-step sequence, mention it explicitly.
Relevant STM: The last 20-50 lines or an even shorter summarization.
Relevant MTM: Summaries of code structure, latest test results, known issues. Possibly references to multiple steps if it helps.
Potential LTM references: If a known best practice or repeated error pattern is recognized, attach a short snippet.
LLM Output

The LLM proposes actions and includes reasoning or short bullet points that you parse programmatically.
System Execution

If the LLM requests a tool action (file creation, shell command), your system attempts it.
Log the results: success/failure, system messages, or environment output.
Memory Update & Summarization

Add the new info to STM and/or MTM.
If any new best-practice or repeated error is recognized, consider storing it in LTM.
If the memory grows large, auto-summarize older data in the form: “We tried approach A twice, got error B both times, concluded it’s not viable.”
Repeat

Insert the updated memory in the next iteration.
Continue until success or an unrecoverable crash.
4.2 Preventing Repetition or “Head-Banging”
Failure Counters: For each approach or sub-approach, store a counter in MTM. If the same approach is tried 2-3 times with no improvement, automatically request a new strategy from the LLM.
Timestamp or Iteration Count: Tag each approach with a timestamp (iteration number). If it’s too old or repeated too often, the LLM is prompted to pivot.
Self-Critique Encouragement: Increase the emphasis on Step 4 in the prompt if repeated failures are detected: “You have attempted this approach X times. Provide a new or significantly revised approach.”
5. Token Efficiency Tactics
Iterative Summaries: Instead of appending entire conversation logs, after each iteration:
Summarize into minimal bullet points.
Replace large code blocks with references or file paths if the code is in external files.
Memory “Checkpointing”: If code is stable or a sub-task is complete, archive the details in a separate “checkpoints” section, only re-insert them if relevant.
Use “Metadata + Snippets”: For big code files, store a short metadata summary (“File foo.py: handles data parsing, last changed at iteration 7, known bug in function X, recommended fix is Y”) plus a reference link. Provide the actual code only if specifically needed in a subsequent iteration.
Batch Retrieval: If the LLM is requesting multiple references, group them into a single chunk instead of multiple smaller pieces to reduce overhead.
6. Advanced & Novel Memory Ideas
Graph-Based Memory

Represent each “concept” (e.g. a module, a bug, a sub-goal) as a node in a graph. Link nodes for relationships (“bug B encountered in module M at iteration i”).
The LLM or a separate “memory retrieval system” can query this graph to compile a short summary for the next iteration’s context.
This cuts down on random text sprawl and organizes knowledge in a structured way.
Confidence / Relevance Scoring

Assign each memory piece (like an approach or code snippet) a confidence or relevance score. The system decays this score over time. If it’s very low, it’s either pruned or summarized.
If an approach is repeatedly failing, its confidence score drops rapidly. That triggers the LLM to avoid it in future suggestions.
Auto-Indexing

Each time new knowledge is added, you run a short “indexing routine” that extracts key tokens or embeddings, so you can find it later without scanning the entire text.
Dedicated Summarization Micro-LLM

You could have a smaller/cheaper LLM whose sole job is to read the last iteration’s raw output and produce a crisp summary. This summary is what’s fed into your main LLM in the next iteration.
This approach helps keep context short while preserving relevant details.
7. Putting It All Together: Example Flow
Here’s a sample of how one iteration might look in practice:

System: Builds the next prompt.

Goal Prompt: The big task (“Build a web scraper that logs into a site and downloads CSV data.”).

Tool Menu: Contains references to file I/O, shell, etc.

Short-Term Memory: Summarized bullet points from the last iteration (e.g., “We attempted a GET request; it returned error 403. We suspect we need authentication.”).

Medium-Term Memory:

Key environment details (e.g., “We have a function login() that returns a session token.”)
Past attempts (some approach IDs + status).
Long-Term Memory:

Possibly a snippet reminding the AI of a known approach for web authentication from a previous project.
Instructions: “Follow the eight-step reasoning. Currently we are at Step 4 (Self-Critique) because we’ve had repeated 403 errors. Provide a new plan to fix it. If you detect we need to revisit earlier steps, do so.”

LLM:

Reads the context, identifies the repeated error, and suggests a new approach (maybe using cookies or a new library).
Provides a short self-critique of why the last approach might have failed.
System:

Parses that plan, executes it (e.g., runs the code).
Gathers results or errors.
Summarizes them in bullet points → updates STM & MTM.
If something fundamentally changed, it might add a new note to LTM, e.g., “Using library X for authentication on Site Y typically requires custom headers.”
Next Iteration:

The system sees success or failure, updates the relevant memory, and moves on to Step 5 or Step 6, etc.
This continues until the final product is done or a major error arises.
8. Conclusion
By explicitly weaving the eight-step reasoning guidelines into your infinite-loop system—and backing it with a robust multi-tier memory strategy (short, medium, long) with novel summarization, pruning, and relevance scoring—you can:

Prevent repeated failures or fruitless loops.
Maintain consistent context across multiple steps without overwhelming token limits.
Promote continuous learning: once the system finds a new best practice or a repeated mistake, it can store this knowledge in LTM for future usage.
Enhance clarity and coherence: each iteration reaffirms the project’s current status and next steps, so the system rarely “forgets” where it stands.
This framework should significantly improve accuracy, reduce token usage, and ensure that your autonomous coding/engineering agent can plan effectively, adapt to challenges, and evolve with each iteration.
