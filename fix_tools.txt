You have a Python project called "LLM_kit" that includes tests for various inline tools: file, shell, http_request, package_manager, documentation_check, code_runner, computer, web_browser, and web_search. The test suite is:

pytest tests/tools/integration/test_tools_integration.py -v

produces:

Test results summary:

3 tests pass (doc_check, code_runner, web_search).
6 tests fail (file, shell, requests, package_manager, computer, web_browser).
Here is a condensed portion of the failing test logs (some lines omitted for brevity):

test_file_tool_integration FAIL: AssertionError: Expected the file to be created by file_write Captured debug lines: DEBUG: Found tool call: file_write DEBUG: Formatted JSON: {'tool': 'file', 'input_schema': {'operation': 'write', 'path': 'rite("/tmp/pytest-of-justin/pytest-5/test_file_tool_integration0/integration_test.txt', 'content': 'Hello from the file tool!'}}

Notice the 'path' is incorrect; it has "rite(...)" instead of the actual "/tmp/pytest-of-justin/...".

test_shell_tool_integration FAIL: AssertionError: Shell tool did not echo as expected: Captured debug lines: DEBUG: Found tool call: shell DEBUG: Formatted JSON: {'tool': 'shell', 'input_schema': {'command': 'echo IntegrationTest'}} DEBUG: Parser result:

The shell command runs, but the final test sees an empty string. The output "IntegrationTest" doesn't appear in the final result.

test_requests_tool_integration FAIL: AssertionError: Expected to see JSON from httpbin in the result

Same pattern: the parser recognizes the tool call, but the final result is empty or missing the body.

test_package_manager_integration FAIL: AssertionError: Expected to see some package in the listing:

Again, the tool call is recognized but no output is appended to the final text.

test_computer_tool_integration FAIL: AssertionError: Expected system info in result

The "computer({'action':'system_info'})" call is overshadowed by a validation error triggered by leftover text from a previous call. The parser lumps multiple calls together or short-circuits.

test_web_browser_tool_integration FAIL: AssertionError: Expected to see text from example.com

Same story: "web_browser(...)" is recognized but the final text is missing the "Example Domain" string.

The 3 passing tests:

test_doc_check_tool_integration
test_code_runner_tool_integration
test_web_search_tool_integration They either do not rely on specific returned strings or happen to pass the parser logic.
CODE AND EXPLANATION
Below is the relevant parser code (abbreviated). We suspect the argument parsing or the final text assembly is broken.

class InlineCallParser: TOOL_NAME_MAP = { "print": "code_runner", "code_runner": "code_runner", "shell": "shell", "documentation_check": "documentation_check", "file_read": "file", "file_write": "file", "file_delete": "file", "web_search": "web_search", "web_browser": "web_browser", "http_request": "http_request", "package_manager": "package_manager", "write_memory": "memory", "read_memory": "memory", "list_memory": "memory" }

def feed(self, text_chunk: str, debug: bool = True) -> str:
    # ...
    # 1) We search for function calls like shell("some command")
    # 2) We parse them into JSON with { "tool":"shell","input_schema":{...}}
    # 3) We pass that JSON to RealTimeToolParser
    # 4) We return RealTimeToolParser's final string result

def _parse_args(self, args_str: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Splits function arguments by commas, looks for key=value vs. positional args.
    E.g. shell("echo hello"), file_write("somepath","some content")

    # ...
    # The bug: "file_write(" might be messing up the first argument
    # so that 'file_write(' is not stripped properly, leaving
    # 'rite("/tmp/...' in the path.

def _format_tool_call(self, func_name: str, args: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Given the function name and arguments, produce the final tool JSON:
      { "tool": "file", "input_schema": { "operation":"write", "path":"...", "content":"..." } }

    but the actual substring is incorrectly removing the first character of the path or leaving
    leftover characters in the argument if we do not handle indexing carefully.
    """
And our RealTimeToolParser:

class RealTimeToolParser: def feed(self, text_chunk: str) -> str: # ... # Once a complete JSON block "TOOL_CALL: {...}" is found, we parse it, call the tool, # and store the tool result in self.history. However, we do NOT always insert that # result back into the returned text, so the final text from feed(...) can end up empty.

def _handle_complete_tool_call(self):
    # ...
    # parse JSON, call tool_object.run(input=inputs)
    # result = tool_object.run(...)
    # DOES NOT necessarily append 'result' to any text that the final test sees
    # So test_shell_tool_integration sees an empty string, failing the assertion
    # that "IntegrationTest" in result
PRIMARY ISSUES
Argument parsing is broken for calls like file_write("...path...","...content...").

The parser is slicing off the initial letter of the first argument if the function name includes an underscore (like file_write).
So the path becomes something like "rite("/tmp/pytest-of-justin/...")" instead of "/tmp/pytest-of-justin/...".
Tool output never gets appended to the final text that the test checks.

Even if ShellTool.run() returns "IntegrationTest", the final text from InlineCallParser.feed() or RealTimeToolParser.feed() remains empty.
As a result, assert "IntegrationTest" in result fails because result is "".
Validation and leftover text can short-circuit multiple calls in one chunk.

If the parser sees a validation error from a partially malformed call, it stops or lumps subsequent calls into one big string, generating more errors.
WHAT WE WANT
Please update/fix the parser code (or provide a patch) so that:

Each inline call (e.g. file_write("foo", "bar")) parses its arguments correctly.
The path argument must not lose characters.
Possibly the underscore in the function name is confusing _parse_args(), or the parser is incorrectly ignoring the substring length.
When a tool call completes successfully, the tool’s output (the string returned by tool.run(...)) should appear in the final text that the test receives.
We want shell("echo IntegrationTest") to produce a final string containing "IntegrationTest".
Same for requests_tool, package_manager_tool, computer_tool, and web_browser_tool, so they can pass their assert checks.
If a validation error happens, it should not necessarily cancel subsequent calls in the same text chunk.
Or at least, we should gracefully skip the bad call but still parse the next one, if that’s possible in your design.
The end goal: Running pytest tests/tools/integration/test_tools_integration.py -v will pass all 9 tests.

Instructions:

Review both _parse_args() and _format_tool_call() to ensure arguments are extracted correctly.
Make sure the substring that identifies file_write( does not also chop off part of the path argument.
In the RealTimeToolParser.feed() (and _handle_complete_tool_call()), append the tool’s returned string to the final text so the test’s result includes it. For example, you might store that in output_to_user or some aggregator string that gets returned.
Provide your revised code or a patch.
Ensure all 9 integration tests pass after your fix.
That’s it. Please provide the corrected parser so all 9 tests pass.
