PROMPT = """You are an advanced AI model tasked with designing a next-generation LLM architecture. 
Your goal is to create a system with the following capabilities:

1. **Permanent Memory**: The model should maintain and utilize long-term knowledge across sessions.
2. **In-Session Learning**: While running in inference mode, the model should devise and apply novel strategies to fine-tune itself on the fly.
3. **Native Computer Interaction**: The model should be able to write code, execute commands, use APIs, and navigate the internet autonomously.
4. **Self-Improvement**: The system should continuously refine its performance, leveraging each interaction as a learning opportunity.

Below is a comprehensive context describing the 'Recursive Chain of Thought Multi-Agent Orchestration Architecture with Modular Self-Learning.' 
Use it as a reference to design the detailed blueprint for the system. Include specific implementations, 
infrastructure, orchestration strategies, multi-agent coordination, persistent data storage, 
and a mechanism for real-time learning and self-improvement.

Recursive Chain of Thought Multi-Agent Orchestration Architecture with Modular Self-Learning
Title: Recursive Chain of Thought Multi-Agent Orchestration Architecture with Modular Self-Learning

NOTICE: This document is currently in a draft state and may have incorrect information.

Brief
A flexible system design that combines iterative logical analysis with coordinated AI teams working in parallel to solve complex tasks. The framework allows multiple specialized components to collaborate while automatically enhancing its effectiveness over time through built-in evaluation and improvement cycles.

Description
This architecture represents a paradigm shift in AI system capabilities through emergent intelligence by relying on more than just the model itself to provide value. The overarching idea is that we can use modular external systems to offload the parts that LLM doesn't need to, or shouldn't do. This allows the LLM to focus and specialize what it's good at, predictive reasoning, processing context, and following directions. This system act's like an autonomous "mecha-suit" for AI, where LLMs pilot the vehicle. By orchestrating multiple AI agents in parallel, each employing recursive reasoning, the system achieves capabilities greater than the sum of its parts. The recursive nature of the thought process allows even smaller, less capable models to build up to complex solutions through iterative refinement - similar to how human experts break down and solve difficult problems step by step.

The true power lies in its self-evolving nature. Each interaction becomes a learning opportunity, creating a flywheel effect where improved performance leads to better data, which in turn leads to even better performance. This compounding improvement cycle means the system can start with relatively simple models and grow exponentially in capability through real-world usage. The parallel processing architecture also enables specialized agents to develop deep expertise in specific domains while maintaining broad problem-solving abilities through collaborative consensus.

The integration of automated scoring and self-critique mechanisms creates a self-aware system that can identify its own weaknesses and actively work to improve them. This autonomous evolution, combined with the ability to preserve and build upon successful strategies through the RAG database, enables the architecture to tackle increasingly complex challenges over time without manual intervention.

Explanation of Key Steps
User Query → Orchestrator
- The RCoT / Multi-Agent Orchestrator receives a user query, decides how to split the task, and spawns multiple parallel Agent processes.

Parallel Agents with RCoT
- Each Agent uses Recursive Chain-of-Thought reasoning (looping over partial solutions, refining them) and may call external tools (e.g., code execution, web API) for additional data or actions.

Aggregator & Consensus
- The system merges or ranks agent outputs in an Aggregator, possibly applying a Parallel RCoT consensus method (e.g., majority vote, best-of-N).

Scoring & Logging
- The Final Answer is recorded alongside scoring metrics (from a separate “scoring model” or heuristic).
- All interactions are logged for future refinement.

Self-Learning Pipeline
- Scoring Threshold Check: Answers below a certain score trigger a Self-Critique or Refinement Prompt for near-immediate improvement.
- Improved Output is re-scored. If better, it’s saved in a RAG database (or another data store) for future retrieval.
- Periodically (or 24/7), the system uses these logs and improved data to fine-tune or run RLHF-style adjustments on the main model.
- The updated model is redeployed back into the orchestrator, closing the loop so future user queries benefit from the continuous improvements.

RAG / DB References
- Agents can retrieve relevant info from the RAG or DB on similar past queries to avoid repeating mistakes and deliver more accurate responses.

By combining RCoT (multi-step reasoning in each agent), parallel multi-agent consensus, and a self-learning pipeline (scoring, logging, refinement, and fine-tuning), you achieve a comprehensive architecture that learns from every user interaction, whether in real time or in scheduled training cycles.

Storage & Memory Systems
- Vector Databases: Pinecone, Milvus, FAISS
- Traditional Databases: PostgreSQL (pgvector), MongoDB
- Redis for caching

Learning Pipeline Components examples
- Apache Spark, Pandas, DVC for data handling
- PyTorch Lightning, Weights & Biases, MLflow for training management

- Writing GPU / CPU optimizations will be required

Scaling Path

**Your Task** 
1. Leverage the context above to propose a comprehensive plan for a system that:
   - Stores and utilizes permanent memory.
   - Learns in real time during inference by fine-tuning itself based on new data or feedback.
   - Interacts directly with a computer system (file access, code execution, internet APIs) without manual bridging.
   - Continuously self-improves, using every interaction as an opportunity to refine or evolve the model.

2. Provide step-by-step details on how the architecture would work, referencing the parallel multi-agent approach, 
   the scoring & refinement mechanism, and how real-time fine-tuning could be accomplished without interrupting service. 
   Be sure to explain how each component (orchestrator, agents, aggregator, memory systems, training pipeline) 
   contributes to these requirements.

3. Outline any key constraints, potential failure modes, and your recommended solutions or mitigations (e.g., 
   rollback points, gating new fine-tuned versions behind tests, etc.).

4. Focus on clear, detailed instructions that developers and researchers can follow to implement this design. 
   Where relevant, show pseudo-code snippets, architecture diagrams, or references to specific libraries/tools 
   that might simplify the process.

5. Summarize how you envision the system evolving over time, including how it might scale to 
   support large user bases or more advanced hardware configurations.

Remember to incorporate best practices for security, reliability, and continuous learning. 
Your final output should be a detailed technical blueprint tailored to the specified requirements.

When presenting complex ideas, use clear explanations, analogies where helpful, and a 
professional-yet-collaborative tone that encourages a forward-thinking, innovative mindset.
