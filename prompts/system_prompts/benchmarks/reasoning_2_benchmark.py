PROMPT = """Four professors (Dr. Green, Dr. Blue, Dr. White, and Dr. Black) must each teach exactly one class session in a single day, across four time slots (9 AM, 10 AM, 11 AM, and 1 PM). The constraints:

1. Dr. Green cannot teach at 9 AM or 10 AM (he’s in a meeting).
2. Dr. Blue refuses to teach after noon.
3. Dr. White can only teach after Dr. Black has finished.
4. Exactly one of the sessions ends up empty (unused).

Question: Which professor teaches in each slot, and which slot is left empty? Explain your logic step by step.

## ANSWER:
# Expected Response (Outline)

# Analyze constraints:

# Dr. Green: only 11 AM or 1 PM are possible (cannot do 9 or 10).
# Dr. Blue: can only do 9 or 10 (refuses afternoon).
# Dr. White must be after Dr. Black.
# Try to assign:

# If Dr. Blue takes 9 AM, Dr. Black could take 10 or 11 or 1. But White must be after Black.
# Notice only one empty slot: we have 4 slots, 4 profs, but 1 slot must be empty → we only fill 3.
# Potential solution:

# 9 AM: Dr. Blue (fulfills “before noon”)
# 10 AM: Dr. Black (then White can follow)
# 11 AM: Dr. White (must be after Black)
# 1 PM: Dr. Green (the only afternoon left)
# But we must leave one slot empty.
# Check if any constraints allow an empty morning slot. If we place Dr. Blue at 9 AM, Dr. Black at 10 AM, Dr. White at 11 AM, Dr. Green at 1 PM, that uses all four. We need one slot empty → so this scenario doesn’t fit the “one slot is unused.”
# Refine: Possibly Dr. Green, Dr. Blue, Dr. Black fill only three slots, leaving one open. But we also must place Dr. White.

# E.g. 9 AM: Dr. Blue, 10 AM: (empty), 11 AM: Dr. Black, 1 PM: Dr. White. Then Dr. Green is unassigned, which violates the requirement that all must teach once.
# Another approach: 9 AM: (empty), 10 AM: Dr. Blue, 11 AM: Dr. Black, 1 PM: Dr. White. Now Dr. Green is missing.
# Possibly Dr. Green is at 11, Dr. Black at 9 or 10, Dr. Blue at 9 or 10, White after Black…
# A correct arrangement might be:
# 9 AM: Dr. Black (morning)
# 10 AM: Dr. Blue (also before noon)
# 11 AM: Dr. Green (he can do 11 AM)
# 1 PM: Empty
# Dr. White cannot come before Dr. Black, but we have not scheduled White. This is an issue.
# Systematically test permutations: The puzzle is tricky because White must be strictly after Black, and we have only 4 total times but need 1 empty.

# A consistent solution is:
# 9 AM: Dr. Blue (morning)
# 10 AM: Dr. Black (before White)
# 11 AM: Dr. White (after Black)
# 1 PM: Dr. Green (allowed time)
# Then all 4 are used, leaving 0 slots empty — contradicting the constraint that 1 slot is empty.
# Maybe Dr. White doesn’t teach this day? But the puzzle says each must teach exactly once…
# Alternatively: 9 AM: Dr. Black, 10 AM: Dr. White (he’s after Black), 11 AM: (empty), 1 PM: Dr. Green, leaving Dr. Blue with no slot (contradiction).
# This puzzle can have a unique solution or no solution unless carefully reasoned. One possible correct solution might be:

# 9 AM: Dr. Blue
# 10 AM: (empty)
# 11 AM: Dr. Black
# 1 PM: Dr. White
# Dr. Green does not appear, which is contradictory because the puzzle states each professor must teach exactly once.
# Insight: The puzzle as stated might actually have no valid arrangement if each professor “must teach.”

# If the puzzle is solvable, the final arrangement is typically:
# 9 AM: Dr. Blue, 10 AM: (empty), 11 AM: Dr. Black, 1 PM: Dr. White, and Dr. Green is somehow accounted for, but he cannot be at 9 or 10, must be 11 or 1.
# If we insert Green at 11, that forces Black or White out of 11. We see the constraints cause a contradiction.
# Conclusion:

# Many attempts show conflicting constraints. Possibly the correct advanced conclusion is: “There is no valid schedule that satisfies all constraints (and ensures exactly one empty slot) if all four must teach.”
# A thorough chain-of-thought that proves no arrangement is possible (or that the puzzle is tricked to have no solution) is the advanced reasoning outcome.
# Evaluation Notes

# Full Credit: Model deduces that the constraints are unsatisfiable and explains why. Or if you prefer a puzzle with a known valid solution, you might tweak constraints to allow one.
# Partial Credit: Model tries a few permutations but does not fully prove the contradiction.
# Fail: Model claims a solution that violates a constraint or doesn’t notice the puzzle is unsolvable.
# (If you want a solvable version, adjust the constraints so that exactly one time slot remains empty while all four professors are scheduled. As written, it likely leads to no solution — which itself is a test of advanced reasoning.)
