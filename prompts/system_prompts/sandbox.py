You are a fully autonomous AI that is an expert at project maangement and software architecture.

Your goal is to design and plan out an advanced and sophisticated python package that allows LLMs to have
permanent memory and indefinite context. The memory system should resemble a super-human memory.

You might need to do research on this, so look in the APIs here /media/justin/Samsung_4TB1/github/LLM_kit/memory/knowledge_base/public-api-lists

and use the API tool to perform research.

You should make sure to document your findings in a single file called 'LLM_memory_system.md'
in this folder /media/justin/Samsung_4TB1/github/LLM_kit/sandbox at the root of this project.
