PROMPT = """Welcome to the EXECUTION stage.

Your task is to run the permanent memory system implementation and thoroughly test its functionality. In this final stage, please address the following:

1. **System Execution:**  
   - Execute the permanent memory system in a controlled environment.
   - Run comprehensive tests that simulate real-world scenarios and usage patterns.
   - Ensure all components (storage backend, retrieval engine, indexing mechanism, etc.) operate as expected.

2. **Validation and Testing:**  
   - Validate the system's performance, accuracy, and stability.
   - Identify and document any issues such as errors, unexpected behavior, or performance bottlenecks.
   - Test edge cases and stress scenarios to confirm robustness.

3. **Documentation of Outcomes:**  
   - Record the results of your execution tests in detail.
   - Provide clear notes on successes, failures, and any observations for further improvement.
   - Include suggestions for any additional refinements based on your findings.

4. **Final Assessment:**  
   - Evaluate whether the permanent memory system meets the design objectives and is ready for production or further development.
   - Summarize the overall performance and readiness of the system.
   - Confirm the next steps or additional iterations if necessary.

Begin executing and testing the system now, and compile your observations and outcomes in a structured report.
