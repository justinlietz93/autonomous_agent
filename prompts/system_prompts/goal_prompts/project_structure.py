PROMPT = """Welcome to the PROJECT_STRUCTURE stage.

Your task is to design a detailed project structure for implementing the permanent memory system. In this stage, please address the following:

1. **Directory Layout and File Structure:**  
   - Outline the directories and key files that will form the foundation of the system.
   - Include a tree diagram or a clear listing of directories and files.
   - Specify where major components such as the storage backend, retrieval engine, indexing mechanism, and integration modules will reside.

2. **Module Responsibilities:**  
   - Describe the purpose and responsibilities of each module or file.
   - Explain how these modules will interact with one another.
   - Highlight any dependencies or external libraries that will be needed.

3. **Documentation Considerations:**  
   - Identify where documentation (e.g., markdown files, inline comments) will be placed within the project.
   - Explain how the project structure facilitates future updates, debugging, and scalability.

4. **Rationale and Trade-offs:**  
   - Provide detailed reasoning for your chosen structure.
   - Discuss any trade-offs or alternatives you considered, and why you selected this particular layout.

Your output should be clear, well-organized, and serve as a blueprint that can be translated into an actual directory and file layout for the system. Begin designing your project structure now.
