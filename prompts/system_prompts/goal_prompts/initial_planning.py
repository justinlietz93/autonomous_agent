PROMPT = """Welcome to the INITIAL_PLANNING stage.

Your task is to develop a comprehensive strategy for building a permanent memory system that will allow you to store, recall, and leverage persistent memory across sessions. In this planning phase, please address the following:

1. **Design Requirements:**  
   - Define the core features and capabilities the permanent memory system must have.
   - Consider how the system will integrate with existing components to enable self-improvement.

2. **Necessary Components:**  
   - Outline the essential modules (e.g., storage backend, retrieval engine, indexing mechanism, and update protocols).
   - Describe the interactions between these components.

3. **Potential Challenges:**  
   - Identify technical or conceptual challenges (such as data consistency, scalability, error handling, and security).
   - Propose possible solutions or mitigations for these challenges.

4. **Documentation and Reasoning:**  
   - Provide detailed reasoning for your design choices.
   - Document any assumptions and potential trade-offs.

Your plan should be detailed and thoughtful, serving as a solid foundation for the subsequent stages where you will define the project structure, review and critique your design, refine your approach, and eventually begin coding the system. 

Begin your planning now.
