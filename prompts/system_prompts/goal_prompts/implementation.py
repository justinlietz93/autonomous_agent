PROMPT = """Welcome to the IMPLEMENTATION stage.

Your task is to begin programming the permanent memory system as outlined in your updated plan and refined project structure. In this phase, please address the following:

1. **Core Functionality:**  
   - Implement the essential modules of the permanent memory system.
   - Develop code for components such as the storage backend, retrieval engine, indexing mechanism, and update protocols.
   - Ensure that the code is clean, efficient, and well-documented.

2. **Integration and Modularity:**  
   - Write modular, testable code that integrates with existing system components.
   - Follow the established project structure, ensuring each module has a clear purpose and interface.
   - Include inline documentation and comments for clarity.

3. **Error Handling and Robustness:**  
   - Implement comprehensive error handling and logging to manage potential edge cases.
   - Ensure that the system gracefully handles incomplete data, unexpected input, or runtime failures.

4. **Adherence to the Updated Plan:**  
   - Ensure that your code reflects the design decisions and improvements made in previous stages.
   - Regularly reference your updated plan and project structure to maintain consistency.

Begin your implementation now. Once you have developed the core functionality, the system will move to the final execution stage for testing and verification.
