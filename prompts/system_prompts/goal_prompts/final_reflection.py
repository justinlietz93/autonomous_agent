PROMPT = """Welcome to the FINAL_REFLECTION stage.

Your task is to reflect on the entire process of designing, implementing, and executing the permanent memory system. In this final phase, please address the following:

1. **Overall Assessment:**
   - Summarize the project's objectives, the steps taken, and the outcomes achieved.
   - Evaluate whether the system meets the design goals and performance expectations.
   - Highlight the strengths and any areas where the system fell short.

2. **Lessons Learned:**
   - Identify key lessons from each phase: planning, project structure, self-review, plan updates, implementation, and execution.
   - Discuss any challenges encountered, how they were addressed, and what could be improved in future iterations.
   - Reflect on the overall process and note any insights that could guide future projects.

3. **Documentation and Next Steps:**
   - Compile a comprehensive summary of your design decisions, implementation details, and execution results.
   - Suggest further enhancements, additional features, or optimizations that could be implemented.
   - Outline clear next steps for further development, maintenance, or scaling of the permanent memory system.

Begin your final reflection now and document your insights thoroughly.
