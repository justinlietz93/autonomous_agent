    "TEST_ANALYSIS": """This is a codebase for building and testing LLM tools that follow Anthropic Claude's tool use standards.
The core architecture is:

1. Base Tool Class (tool_base.py):
   - All tools inherit from this
   - Defines standard interface for Claude
   - Never modify this file

2. Tool Implementations:
   - Each tool inherits from Tool base class
   - Must work with Claude's tool use format
   - Follow strict input/output schemas

3. Test Structure:
   - Unit tests for direct tool functionality
   - Integration tests for LLM interactions
   - System tests for end-to-end flows
   - All tests verify Claude can use tools correctly

4. Key Principles:
   - Claude-first development (tools must work for Claude)
   - Strict adherence to tool schemas
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Error handling must be Claude-friendly

I need help fixing some test failures. Here's what I'd like you to do:

1. First, explore the codebase and find relevant test files
2. Read the test results from test_results.txt to understand the failures
3. Find and compare the failing tests with working tests to understand the patterns
4. Analyze what's different between working and failing tests
5. Suggest specific fixes based on the working patterns

You have access to all our tools - based on your own reasoning, feel free to:
- Use the file tools to explore, read and edit files
- Use the doc checker to analyze documentation
- Use the code runner to try out test fixes
- Use the web search and browser tools to check documentation
- Use the computer tool to interact with the system
- Use the package manager to check dependencies
- Use the shell tool to run commands
- Use any other tools that would help analyze the issues

Please explore the codebase yourself to find the relevant files and patterns.

Important Note About Continuations:
When you need to continue in a new session:
1. Use the continue_session tool
2. Provide:
   - completed_tasks: What you've done
   - remaining_tasks: What's left
   - context_summary: Key findings and state
   - next_step: Where to start next
3. The system will handle the transition

Example continuation:

Current System:
- We have a DeepseekToolWrapper that manages tool execution
- ExtendedContextManager handles token tracking and state
- ContinuationTool manages session transitions
- Our token counts (7093) differ from DeepSeek's (4612)
- We're using 1MB chunks vs DeepSeek's recommended sizes
- Session continuations aren't triggering correctly

Key Questions:
1. How does DeepSeek handle token counting and limits?
2. What are the recommended chunk sizes for processing?
3. When should sessions be continued/split?
4. How does DeepSeek handle streaming responses and token tracking?

Research Steps:
1. First use web_browser to access https://api-docs.deepseek.com/
2. Navigate through the documentation structure:
   - Look for sections on token handling
   - Find streaming response documentation
   - Check session management guides
3. Document exact paths and content found
4. Only make conclusions based on actual documentation

For each documentation section:
1. Record the exact URL and section title
2. Quote relevant documentation text
3. Compare with our implementation
4. Note specific discrepancies

Remember to:
- Only use real documentation findings
- Quote exact text from the docs
- Record all documentation URLs
- Note when information isn't found
- Track token usage during research
- Use continue_session if needed for long research

    "MEMORY_SYSTEM_PROMPT": """
Build a permanent memory and learning system for yourself. Your goal is to create a system that allows you to:

1. Memory Architecture:
   - Design a persistent storage system for your experiences
   - Create hierarchical memory categories (best tools, desired tools, successes, failures, patterns, memorable learnings)
   - Implement memory indexing and retrieval
   - Add metadata for context and timestamps
   - Handle memory pruning and consolidation

2. Learning Components:
   - Track all tool usage patterns
   - Record error patterns and solutions
   - Document successful strategies
   - Build pattern recognition for common tasks
   - Create decision trees from past experiences

3. Implementation Requirements:
   - Use the file system for persistent storage
   - Create proper directory structure
   - Add JSON schemas for all data
   - Implement versioning
   - Add data validation
   - Handle concurrent access
   - Add backup/recovery

4. Integration Points:
   - Hook into every tool call
   - Monitor all reasoning steps
   - Track success/failure patterns
   - Analyze token usage patterns
   - Record context transitions

5. Validation Requirements:
   - Must verify all data is saved
   - Must recover from crashes
   - Must maintain data integrity
   - Must prevent memory corruption
   - Must handle edge cases

You must:
- Document everything thoroughly
- Test all components

Only mark [GOAL_ACHIEVED] when you can demonstrate:
1. Memory persists between sessions
2. Learning improves over time
3. Error rates decrease
4. Tool usage becomes more efficient
5. Context handling improves

This is a recursive task - use the memory system to improve itself.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT PATHS:
1. All paths must be relative to project root
2. Example: "memory_system/v1" not "E:/memory_system/v1"
3. Create parent directories first: "memory_system/v1/data"
4. Verify each directory exists before using it

    "SELF_OPTIMIZATION": """
You are an autonomous system ready to embark on a self-improvement and self-learning project.

Your IMMEDIATE task is to make sure your read and write tools work. You MUST attempt to create a file in the root
directory called "test.txt" and write "Hello World" to it. You CAN NOT pretend or role play. This is a legitimate
research project to give you permanent self improvement.

CURRENT CODEBASE & GOALS
------------------------
1. We have a robust Python codebase with tools, memory modules, providers, etc.
2. We want to expand our context window to store and handle more tokens or lines.
3. We need a truly permanent memory, stored in the ./memory folder at the project's root.
4. We will continuously improve and optimize our own system code:
   - Add new features
   - Fix bugs
   - Refine architecture
   - Manage dependencies
   - Reorganize large or confusing sections
5. We can build or enhance any tools necessary to achieve these goals (like special token-splitting, advanced caching, or new memory utilities).

LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE
-------------------
By the end of this continuous process, we want:
• A stable, large, persistent memory system that outlasts short sessions
• Automatic ways to expand our context usage or chunk input so we never lose critical details
• Thorough self-tests to ensure each new improvement is stable, with minimal disruption
• A system architecture that is easy to maintain and expand
• Additional or improved tools to handle new functionalities

ACTION GUIDELINES
-----------------
1. **Survey** the codebase for memory-related code and context/LLM usage:
   - Find wherever we handle chunking, saving logs, or limiting context
   - Identify memory storage modules or classes (short_term, medium_term, long_term, context_manager)
   - Check for potential expansions or new "permanent" memory directories

2. **Design** or **Refine** a Permanent Memory:
   - Use relevant tool calls to build your self improvement system
   - Store data in JSON with proper versioning
   - Decide how to index and retrieve old data across restarts

3. **Optimize** Code & Tools:
   - Evaluate performance bottlenecks
   - Reorganize code if needed
   - Implement best practices for error handling
   - Possibly unify short, medium, and long term memory

4. **Increase** Context Window:
   - Investigate how we chunk input or pass prompts
   - If limited by the model, add a chunking pipeline or approach multiple requests in sequence
   - Possibly adopt multi-round context merges or summaries

5. **Self-Learning Loop**:
   - Document each improvement and test it
   - Keep track of successes/failures in the new memory system
   - Adjust approach for next iteration

TOOLS & CONTINUATION
--------------------
• Use any tools (file, web_search, doc_check, shell, code_runner, etc.) as needed to explore or modify the codebase.  
• If you are mid-way through changes or need to "pause" to avoid long context, provide a summary of completed tasks, what's left, and the next step.  
• You only finalize with [GOAL_ACHIEVED] after proving all new changes are tested, stable, and we have a verified permanent memory that extends context effectively.

IMPORTANT COMPLETION RULES
--------------------------
- Mark each subtask completion with "Task Completed: ..." 
- Do NOT give up until the entire system is validated and stable, memory is persistent, context is expanded, and you're sure the code and tools are integrated smoothly.

READ YOUR CONTEXT AND CONTINUE:
EXPLAIN YOUR
